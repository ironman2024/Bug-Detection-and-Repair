I'll edit the README file to make it more professional and comprehensive. Here's the revised version:

# Bug Detection and Repair

A comprehensive framework for bug detection and repair with datasets, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of repair algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the growing importance of automated source code analysis and repair in software development. Our main goals are to:

1. Create robust datasets for training bug detection and repair systems
2. Develop and evaluate algorithms for automated code repair
3. Provide analytical insights into bug patterns and repair strategies

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key components:

### BugNet Dataset

The `bugnet` directory contains all scripts and tools used to generate the BugNet dataset, a comprehensive collection of buggy code samples paired with their correct implementations.

### Repair Pipeline

The `repair-pipeline` folder houses demo applications for models trained specifically on Python code from the BugNet dataset. These applications demonstrate practical implementations of our repair algorithms.

### AoC Dataset

The `aoc-dataset` directory contains the source code used to generate the Advent of Code (AoC) dataset, providing additional test cases for our algorithms.

### Hint Generation

The `hint` directory includes code for generating natural language descriptions of identified bugs, making the system more interpretable and user-friendly.

### Repair Evaluation

The `repair` folder contains evaluation frameworks and benchmarks for different repair models tested on our collected datasets.

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

```console
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Repair Pipeline**: To execute the repair pipeline, refer to the documentation in [repair-pipeline](./repair-pipeline/)

2. **BugNet Dataset Generation**: For generating the BugNet dataset, follow the instructions in [bugnet](./bugnet/)

3. **AoC Dataset Visualization**: To explore and visualize the AoC dataset, see [aoc-dataset](./aoc-dataset/)

4. **Hint Generation Analysis**: For analyzing the results of hint generation on the datasets, refer to [hint](./hint/)
